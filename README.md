Description
===========

The basic idea of the app is to facilitate the process of evaluate a new apartment, 
room or house to rent. It does not help the user to find it, but to keep track of the 
apartments he or she already found and visited.

One of the things that the app does is to allow the user to register information about 
a certain apartment. The information stored is the basic information needed for rent like 
address, photo, rent price, total price and what is included. Also the user can give 
scores for specific features of the apartment like location, furniture, quality, owner, 
neighborhood, ambience, availability and recommendation.

Another part of the app is where the reviewed places are listed.The information is 
organized in such a way that the user can identify the best options just by looking at 
the list order.The user can choose what will make the order, like price, location, etc.
The objective of the app is not only help the user to organize himself and find the best 
option, but also to help in the moment while he or she is visiting the place. 

Most people forget to ask important questions or to verify certain aspects when visiting 
a certain apartment.With the app in hand while visiting, the user can easily remember what 
he should look at and - as stated before - register it by writing and/or giving a score.
